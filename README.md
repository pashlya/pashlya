- 👋 Hi, I’m Pa Shlya
- 👀 I’m interested in ultimate world domination. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning iOS development, mainly because I use iPhone.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer games, where I want to act as a screen/script-writer. It's absolutely unrelated to my github.
- 📫 Reach my at Twitter, under name of @Pasha75409470.
